# posix Threads
Posix threads in C.
The purpose of this exercise was to simulate a pizza place using posix threads. In order to run execute the shell script which will compile and run the included files, passing the arguments for the random seed and the number of customers/threads to create.
There is a second version where the runtime variables are uploaded via a txt file, check the Read_data_from_file method.
